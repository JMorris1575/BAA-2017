This program is designed to produce bulletin graphics indicating the current progress of a parish's response to the
Bishop's Annual Appeal (BAA). Once the target information is entered for a particular year's campaign all that needs
be done is to enter the current statistics:  pledge amount, amount collected and number of families who have made a
pledge so far; and the program generates a graphic indicating the percent to goal for the pledges, collected amount
and number of families involved. This can be saved as a .bmp, .png, or .jpg file to be printed in the parish bulletin.

Getting Started
---------------

When the program is used for the first time, or after its configuration files have been deleted or damaged, the program
will start with a brief set of instructions in the space where the progress graphic will normally appear. Before you
can use BAA Progress you need to enter the Parish's target goal and the number of registered families in the parish.

Setting Targets
...............

Click on the ``Settings`` menu and select ``Set Targets...`` or simply click on the ``Set Targets`` icon |target| in the
toolbar. This will open a dialog box where you can enter the needed information.

Entering Current Data
.....................

Once the targets have been set you can enter the current data. The entry boxes are conveniently located beneath the
image area and gives you immediate feedback as you enter the amount pledged, amount collected and number of families
participating.

Saving the Graphic
..................

When you are finished entering the current data click on the ``File`` menu and select ``Save Graphic`` to save the
graphic in the default location (initially the ``graphics`` directory in the same directory as the BAA Progress program)
with the default name (initially ``BAA_Progress_Graphic.jpg``), or ``Save Graphic As...`` to choose the location and
name yourself. You can also use the ``Save Graphic`` |save| icon on the toolbar.
You can change the defaults by selecting the ``Settings`` menu and selecting ``Image Options...`` or by clicking the
``Image Options`` icon |imageoptions| on the toolbar. The ``Save Graphic As...`` dialog will also give you the option
of saving your entries as the defaults.

Using the Graphic
.................

Once the graphic is saved you can use it in your bulletin editing program. Use your program's method of entering
images.
