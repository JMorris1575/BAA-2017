I finally figured out how to correct the unresolved references problem I've been getting in PyCharm.

This seems to happen when there is another folder within the project folder, such as src, that contains the actual
program.  The solution seems to be:

File > Settings > Project: [project_name] > Project Interpreter > ** click on gear button at right ** > More... >
   **click on show paths for selected interpreter at bottom right** > ** click on plus sign at upper right ** >
    ** browse to the actual location of your program **

This adds the label "library root" to the location in the Project window (for instance src library root).

After cloning the project onto my laptop computer for vacation I was having trouble getting it to recognize PyQt's
objects. It complained about PyQt5.QtCore and such not being resolved and/or not being listed in __init__.py. I finally
deleted the .idea folder, opened it to make it a new project, set up the python interpreter and followed the
instructions above and it finally worked.
